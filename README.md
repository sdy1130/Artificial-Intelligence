A repository for my AI projects

1. kenken puzzle solver:
This project solves a kenkenpuzzle (size up to 9x9 board) that is represented as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) 
using various propagation methods, such as back-tracking, forward-checking, and Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC). To take the
search even more efficient, it uses heuristics such as, minimum remaining value, degree, and least contraining heuristics.

2. pacman survivial:
This project was aimed to design an optimal algorithm that keeps the pacman alive from the ghosts and helps the pacman to eat
all the food to finish the game in minimum time. A game state is checked every time and heuristic and the pacman behaviour 
is updated accordingly.

3. pacman search:
This project was aimed to design an optimal algorithm that helps the pacman to eat all of its food in minimum time using
various search methods such as, Breath First Search, Depth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A Star Search.
